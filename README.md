## About the Video Course
The PrimeFaces framework is one of the most widely used and full-featured JSF component libraries available. The framework includes a large number of custom components that are easy to incorporate into new and existing JSF applications. PrimeFaces also makes it easy to build rich user interfaces via the use of a customizable dialog framework, easy-to-use Ajax, and the ability to work with UI components with markup or Java code.

Mastering PrimeFaces will take viewers on a whirlwind tour of the custom component library. Viewers will see components in action, and learn to build a custom Java EE application. We will walk through the development of a Java EE application using PrimeFaces components for both desktop and mobile.. After watching the videos, you'll be able to comfortably develop JSF applications along with the PrimeFaces framework.

This course begins by explaining how to incorporate PrimeFaces into your new or existing Java EE project. It uses the NetBeans IDE to build a full-featured Java EE application from the ground up, using PrimeFaces components and framework features. During the initial sections, you will learn how to construct intuitive layouts and input forms to capture data, then present the captured data and edit it with the highly customizable DataTable. You will also learn how to export data into different formats and how to make lists of values to make data entry a breeze.

Next you will learn how to provide useful feedback to users with the PrimeFaces dialog framework and charts. 
Youâ€™ll also learn how to construct visual menus, as well as contextual menus alike Then you'll dive into the PrimeFaces Ajax framework that allows data to seamlessly flow between the client and server.
In the end you'll learn how to take your application anywhere using PrimeFaces mobile and PrimeFaces Push for notifications. And last but not least, the PrimeFaces Extensions project and its benefits.
